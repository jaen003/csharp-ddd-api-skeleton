    DDD API Skeleton In C#
</h1>

## üìã Project Description

This project provides a template that can be used as a code base for many back-end community projects incorporating Domain-Driven Design (DDD). It is a restaurant backoffice microservice that allows you to manage product information and extends its functionalities through communication with other microservices through a messaging broker.

It is built with clean architecture, SOLID principles, and love ‚ù§Ô∏è.

## üé¢ Features

* Logging to file and console with Serilog.
* Domain event information collection using reflection.
* Domain event JSON serialization and deserialization.
* Asynchronous consumption and publishing of domain events using RabbitMQ.
* Retry queue to reprocess failed event bus messages (delivery time can be modified from the `EVENT_BUS_MESSAGE_REDELIVERY_DELAY` environment variable in the `.env` file).
* Dead letter queue to publish failed domain event messages after exceeding the retry limit (message delivery limit can be modified from the `EVENT_BUS_MESSAGE_DELIVERY_LIMIT` environment variable in the `.env` file).
* Connection pool in Entity Framework (pool size can be modified. from the `DATABASE_CONNECTION_POOL_SIZE` environment variable in the `.env` file).
* Database migrations with Entity Framework.
* Key pagination and sorting by field receiving parameters through path.
* Restaurant creation from the `restaurant.created` domain event.
* Middleware to catch exceptions and log events.
* Product creation.
* Search for products by ID and restaurant.
* Product update (price, description, name)
* Product deletion.
* Automatic object mapping with Mapperly.

## üîß Setup

1. [Install Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started).
2. If you are using Linux, [install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/).
3. Create a Docker network:
```bash
docker network create -d bridge csharp_ddd_api_skeleton_network
```
4. Create a Docker container for the RabbitMQ event bus:
```bash
docker run -d -h rabbitmq --restart unless-stopped -v rabbitmq_data:/var/lib/rabbitmq/ -e "RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_USER=guest" -e "RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_PASS=guest" --network csharp_ddd_api_skeleton_network heidiks/rabbitmq-delayed-message-exchange:3.10.2-management
```
5. Create a Docker container for the PostgreSQL database:
```bash
docker run -d -h postgresql --restart unless-stopped -v postgresql_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data -e "POSTGRES_USER=root" -e "POSTGRES_PASSWORD=root" --network csharp_ddd_api_skeleton_network postgres:15.1-alpine
```
6. Clone this project:
```bash 
git clone https://github.com/jaen003/csharp-ddd-api-skeleton csharp-ddd-api-skeleton
```
7. Move to the project folder:
```bash
cd csharp-ddd-api-skeleton
```

## üöÄ Deployment

Once you have completed the [setup steps](#setup), run the following command to deploy the project:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

**NOTE:** This project runs inside a private network and does not expose a public port to access the API. It is recommended to access the API through an API gateway.

## üóÉÔ∏è Migrations

To create a new migration, run the following command:

```bash
dotnet ef migrations add <migration-name> -p Src/Core -o Shared/Infrastructure/Database/Migrations
```

For example, to create a migration that adds a new column to the `Products` table, you would run the following command:

```bash
dotnet ef migrations add AddProductNameColumn -p Src/Core -o Shared/Infrastructure/Database/Migrations
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Variables

You can modify any environment variables in the `.env` file.

## üß™ Running Tests

To run the tests, run the following command:

```bash
make test
```
